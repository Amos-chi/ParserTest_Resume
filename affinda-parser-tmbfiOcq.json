Vehicle Dynamics Project April.2018 • Simulated the linear vehicle model's movement by Simulink and Matlab. • Analyzed and identified the tire cornering stiffness by using the linear bicycle model and the experimental data. • Designed a steering controller to track a predefined path using Pure Pursuit control. Automated vehicles' Sensors and Data Mining Project Mar.2018 • Analyze Lidar/Radar/GPS/Ultrasonic data from rosbag. • Extracted lane change events from a naturalistic driving database using MySQL. Mechatronics Project Sep.-Dec.2017 • Sensor Fusion for Accurate Angular Measurement: integrated an accelerometer along with the low-pass filter and a gyro along with the high-pass filter for the pendulum tilt angle measurement. • Inverted Pendulum Mechatronic System Design: identified the model parameters and designed a full-state feedback control system to stabilize an inverted pendulum through Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR) method and a classical control system with two loops which the inner loop with negative feedback while the out loop with positive feedback. • DC Motor and Stepper Motor Position and Velocity Control: assessed motor's performance characteristics for different input and designed controllers to meet the position and velocity error requirement. Self-Driving Car Project Dec.2017 • Constructed a car obstacles-avoidance controller using PID control. • Achieved the controller with the planned-trajectory as the reference, traction force and steering angle as the control inputs to control the vehicle to follow the trajectory without crashing the track boundary. Robot Kinematics and Dynamics Project Apr.2017 • Developed a robotic arm that can grab a small-size object given its position using Arduino and servo motor. • Implemented DH table and two inverse kinematic methods (MIT rule and inverse Jacobian) to compute the joint angles and transmitted these data into Simulink and Arduino to activate the motor and simulation.\nSKILLS C++, Python, Matlab,
